## [Unreleased]

NIL

## [0.2.0] - 2019-04-20

Complies with [Dirhash Standard](https://github.com/andhus/dirhash) Version [0.1.0](https://github.com/andhus/dirhash/releases/v0.1.0)

### Added

- A first implementation based on the formalized [Dirhash Standard](https://github.com/andhus/dirhash).
- This changelog.
- Results form a new benchmark run after changes. The `benchmark/run.py` now outputs results files which names include the `dirhash.__version__`.

### Changed

- **Significant breaking changes** from version 0.1.1 - both regarding API and the
  underlying method/protocol for computing the hash. This means that **hashes
  computed with this version will differ from hashes computed with version < 0.2.0 for
  same directory**.
- This dirhash python implementation has moved to here
  [github.com/andhus/dirhash-python](https://github.com/andhus/dirhash-python) from
  the previous repository
  [github.com/andhus/dirhash](https://github.com/andhus/dirhash)
  which now contains the formal description of the Dirhash Standard.

### Removed

- All support for the `.dirhashignore` file. This seemed superfluous, please file an
  issue if you need this feature.
