    # Arguments
        directory: Union[str, pathlib.Path] - Path to the directory to hash.
        algorithm: str - The name of the hashing algorithm to use. See
            `dirhash.algorithms_available` for the available options.
        match: Iterable[str] - An iterable of glob/wildcard match-patterns for paths
            to include when computing the hash. Default is ["*"] which means that all
            files and directories are matched.  To e.g. only include python source
            files, use: `match=["*.py"]`. See "Path Selection and Filtering" section
            below for further details.
        ignore: Optional[Iterable[str]] - An iterable of glob/wildcard match-patterns
            for paths to ignore when computing the hash. Default `None` (no ignore
            patterns). To e.g. exclude hidden files and directories use:
            `ignore=[".*/", ".*"]`. See "Path Selection and Filtering" section below
            for further details.
        linked_dirs: bool - If `True` (default), follow symbolic links to other
            *directories* and include these and their content in the hash
            computation.
        linked_files: bool - If `True` (default), include symbolic linked files in
            the hash computation.
        empty_dirs: bool - If `True`, include empty directories when computing the
            hash. A directory is considered empty if it does not contain any files
            that *matches provided matching criteria*. Default `False`, i.e. empty
            directories are ignored (as is done in git version control).
        entry_properties: Iterable[str] - A set (i.e. order does not matter) of the
            file/directory properties to consider when computing the hash. Supported
            properties are {"name", "data", "is_link"} where at least one of
            "name" and "data" must be included. Default is ["name", "data"] which
            means that the content (actual data) as well as the path relative to the
            root `directory` of files will affect the hash value. See "Entry
            Properties Interpretation" section below for further details.
        allow_cyclic_links: bool - If `False` (default) a `SymlinkRecursionError` is
            raised on presence of cyclic symbolic links. If set to `True` the the
            dirhash value for directory causing the cyclic link is replaced with the
            hash function hexdigest of the relative path from the link to the target.
        chunk_size: int - The number of bytes to read in one go from files while
            being hashed. A too small size will slow down the processing and a larger
            size consumes more working memory. Default 2**20 byte = 1 MiB.
        jobs: int - The number of processes to use when computing the hash.
            Default `1`, which means that a single (the main) process is used. NOTE
            that using multiprocessing can significantly speed-up execution, see
            `https://github.com/andhus/dirhash-python/benchmark` for further
            details.

    # Returns
        str - The hash/checksum as a string of the hexadecimal digits (the result of
        `hexdigest` method of the hashlib._hashlib.HASH object corresponding to the
        provided `algorithm`).

    # Raises
        TypeError/ValueError: For incorrectly provided arguments.
        SymlinkRecursionError: In case the `directory` contains symbolic links that
            lead to (infinite) recursion and `allow_cyclic_links=False` (default).

    # Path Selection and Filtering
        Provided glob/wildcard (".gitignore style") match-patterns determine what
        paths within the `directory` to include when computing the hash value. Paths
        *relative to the root `directory`* (i.e. excluding the name of the root
        directory itself) are matched against the patterns.
            The `match` argument represent what should be *included* - as opposed
        to the `ignore` argument for which matches are *excluded*. Using `ignore` is
        just short for adding the same patterns to the `match` argument with the
        prefix "!", i.e. the calls bellow are equivalent:
            `dirhash(..., match=["*", "!<pattern>"])`
            `dirhash(..., ignore=["<pattern>"])`
        To validate which paths are included, call `dirhash.included_paths` with
        the same values for the arguments: `match`, `ignore`, `linked_dirs`,
        `linked_files` and `empty_dirs` to get a list of all paths that will be
        included when computing the hash by this function.

    # Entry Properties Interpretation
        - ["name", "data"] (Default) - The name as well as data is included. Due to
            the recursive nature of the dirhash computation, "name" implies that the
            path relative to the root `directory` of each file/directory affects the
            computed hash value.
        - ["data"] - Compute the hash only based on the data of files -
            *not* their names or the names of their parent directories. NOTE that
            the tree structure in which files are organized under the `directory`
            root still influences the computed hash. As longs as all files have
            the same content and are organised the same way in relation to all
            other files in the Directed Acyclic Graph representing the file-tree,
            the hash will remain the same (but the "name of nodes" does not
            matter). This option can e.g. be used to verify that that data is
            unchanged after renaming files (change extensions etc.).
        - ["name"] - Compute the hash only based on the name and location of
            files in the file tree under the `directory` root. This option can
            e.g. be used to check if any files have been added/moved/removed,
            ignoring the content of each file.
        - "is_link" - if this options is added to any of the cases above the
            hash value is also affected by whether a file or directory is a
            symbolic link or not. NOTE: with this property added, the hash
            will be different than without it even if there are no symbolic links
            in the directory.
